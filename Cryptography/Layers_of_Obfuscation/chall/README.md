🧩🔐 Layers of Obfuscation

Category : Cryptography
Points : 300

During a routine network traffic analysis, your team intercepted a strange encoded message. The sender is known to be careless with cryptographic practices, often relying on simple obfuscation instead of real encryption.

Initial inspection suggests that the message contains a flag in the following format:

Flag Format — BBCTF{...}

However, the message has been processed through multiple transformation layers to hide its contents.

Your task is to analyze the encoding scheme, reverse the transformations, and recover the original flag.
