generate the spectogram using sox or any browser related software.

Notice the first hint that was in the challenge description "ASCIING".
So most practical thing would be to assume that whatever numbers you'd get out of it are in ASCII.
The second hint was in the first 8 frequencies.The hint here being 8, where these frequencies were repeated later at other orders in the spectogram/mp3 file.

So that would deduce the fact that the 3 bit sequences were stored in octal encoding.

Then it should be converted into a decimal, then mapped back into characters using the ASCII table to get the final flag.


look into the other file to see how this challenge was made.
