## Description

At my workplace, a few men were working late into the night on something important.

Monitors still glowing.  
Chairs left out.  
Coffee mugs half empty.

Warning notes covered the desks… but the screens?

Just gibberish.

Strange symbols. Random characters. Meaningless text.

Or at least… that’s what it looks like.

Whatever they were building, they clearly didn’t want it to be understood at first glance.

Maybe it’s not nonsense after all.

Maybe it just needs to be decoded.
