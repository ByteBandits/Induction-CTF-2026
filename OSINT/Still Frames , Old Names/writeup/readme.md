## Step 1 — Start with the given image

We are provided with an image of an old stone church:

`Still_frames.jpg`

Since this is an OSINT challenge, the first step is to perform a **reverse image search**.

---

## Step 2 — Locate the photographer’s gallery

Reverse searching the image leads to matches on **Flickr**, where the photograph appears as part of a larger gallery.

Browsing the gallery reveals multiple related images taken by the same photographer.

One particular image stands out — a photograph of a nearby **school building**.

---

## Step 3 — Identify the school

Checking the image caption/description reveals:

**Catlin High School, Illinois**

This gives us a concrete location and institution to investigate.

---

## Step 4 — Find the printed chronicle

The challenge description mentions:

> a printed keepsake created once a year for one graduating class

This refers to a **yearbook**.

So we search for:

Catlin High School 1991 yearbook

Yearbooks are commonly archived on sites like:

https://classmates.com/

Using the school name and year filters, we locate the **1991 yearbook**.
