## Description

A traveling photographer working in a rural region catalogued old places and quieter streets.

One frame shows a weathered stone church — the image you’ve been given.  
In the same photographer’s gallery, you’ll find another frame: a nearby school, quietly posed in sunlight.

Some traces hidden in those frames — a façade, a plaque, a caption, a filename —  
point toward a printed keepsake created once a year for one graduating class.

Follow those visual breadcrumbs.

Track down that printed chronicle from **1991**.

Find the person credited there as the **editor**.

That name is your answer.
