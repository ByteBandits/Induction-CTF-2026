Step1:
Identify the Event
From the image, the cultural fest name was clearly visible.
The fest is organized by Fluxus, the official cultural body of our college.
Find the Organizer’s Social Media

Step2:
Since Fluxus organizes the fest, their Instagram account was the most likely source of announcements.
Searched Instagram for the official Fluxus page.
Analyze the Hint
The title “The Night Before” implies looking at a post made 24 hours before the fest.

Step3:
So, I checked Fluxus’s Instagram timeline and navigated to posts made one day prior to the fest date.
Locate the Relevant Post
Found a post uploaded approximately 24 hours before the fest.
That post announced the band performing at the fest.
