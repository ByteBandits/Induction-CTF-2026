# The Night Before

---

The spotlight remembers only one night.
A year ago, our college fest reached its peak with a concert that flooded timelines, stories, and reels. Faces were tagged. Stages were lit. Memories were preserved.
But the stage wasn’t silent** before that night**.
Twenty-four hours earlier, the same lights turned on — for an audience that posted less, tagged poorly, and disappeared faster from the internet.
Your task is to uncover who took the stage that day — not nicknames, not assumptions, but the official performing name used by the artists themselves.
