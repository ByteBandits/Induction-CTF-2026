## Description

Someone shared this photo from a quick stop during their train journey through the mountains.

A small railway station sits quietly beside a flowing river.  
No crowds. No signs. No obvious clues.  
Just tracks, water, and wilderness.

Nothing else was said.

Your task is to investigate the image and determine:

- the **city** where this place is located  
- the **exact coordinates** of the spot where the photo was taken  

Round the latitude and longitude to **two decimal places**.
