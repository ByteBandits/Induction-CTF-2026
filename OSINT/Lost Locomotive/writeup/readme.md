From the image, we can see a small railway station surrounded by mountains and a river, suggesting a remote mountainous region.

Looking closely, there is also a parked train with the number **500** visible on the front. This becomes an important clue.

Performing a reverse image search on just the train leads to information about **PeruRail**, which operates tourist trains between Cusco, Ollantaytambo, and Aguas Calientes (near Machu Picchu).

This tells us the location is likely somewhere along this railway route in Peru.

Searching these stations on Google Maps and checking Street View, we compare the surroundings and structures with the challenge image. The scenery and layout match **Ollantaytambo Railway Station** exactly.

Reading the coordinates of that spot and rounding to two decimal places gives:

## 🏁 Flag

**`BBCTF{ollantaytambo_-13.26_-72.27}`**
