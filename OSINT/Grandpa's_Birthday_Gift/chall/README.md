# Grandpa's Birthday Gift

**Category** : OSINT
**Points** : 200

My granddad’s birthday is coming up next weekend, and I’ve been trying to figure out the perfect gift for him. Honestly, I had no idea what to get until yesterday, when I suddenly remembered something he’s always talking about.
He often tells me about a short film he saw as a child, something like a cartoon. I’m not sure of the exact English word, since I’m not a native speaker, but it was an animated film made with cut-out paper silhouettes. It was all in black and white, very shadowy in style. He says it is more than  a century old.
As far as he remembers, the story was about a princess who was imprisoned by her father in a tower, and a fisherman who rescues her. He doesn’t remember many details beyond that.
I thought, what better gift than trying to find that film? It would mean so much to him, and it would save me from buying yet another sweater, haha. So, could you help me track it down? That would be amazing.
Thanks a lot, and good luck!
