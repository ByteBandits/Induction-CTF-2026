**OSINT • 300 Points**

## Description

A lone cycle rests where the journey paused.
No records remain — only what the frame reveals.

Tracks curve gently past silent fencing,
grass worn thin by time and passing wheels,
while distant heights watch without reply.

The rider is gone,
but the choice of stopping was not random.

Follow the route that led them here.
Find the point where wheels met earth and waited.
