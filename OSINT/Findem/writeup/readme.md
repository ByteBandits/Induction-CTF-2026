## Step 1 — Overview of the Description

As the description says we need to find a certain Institution and some details about students over there, so firstly we'll start with the reverse search of the **`Image.jpg`**.<br> We'll get to know that it's an old image of **IIT Indore**.

## Step 2 — Understanding the clues

Now as we got the college name, the next line starts to makes sense, *"Every year, a few selected candidates receive an offer..."*
, this is telling us about the JoSAA seat allocation rounds, specifically those who got a seat but didn't registered for it.<br>
Then it says that the one who got into this college had to go through a difficult time last November, and as of IIT Indore, we had our End-sem Examination (which is indeed a tough time), and specially focussing on the last Friday of the month, that is 28th Nov. <br>
*"On the last Friday of that month, a specific group, currently in their middle year, were free from this ordeal."*
<br> So on the 28th Nov. a specific group, more like students from a **same Branch**, currently in their middle year, that is the **2nd yr**, they were free from this ordeal, means, they **didn't had any exam that day**, 

So if you go through the schedule of the end-sem of the last semester, you can see that the 2nd year students of Chemical Engineering didn't had any exam that day.

## Step 3 — Getting the final details

The challange want to know the name of the students who got a seat in IIT Indore, in Chemical Engg., 2 yrs ago. but they didn't accepted it.

Now if we go to the official website of IIT Indore, you can find the list of all the students who were offered a seat:
https://academic.iiti.ac.in/Admission/2024/IITI-2024-BTech.pdf

After you get this, just tally it with the students who are currently studying in the college and you'll get the name required for the flag.
