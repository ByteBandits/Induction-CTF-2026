## Description

In the heart of the country stands an institution. You just have its image, but finding the place isn’t the goal.

This challenge isn’t about those who made it in.
It’s about those who almost did.

Every year, a few selected candidates receive an offer but never register, carrying the quiet regret of what could have been. While their would-be batchmates lived campus life, but last November brought them a demanding phase  that required courage to *pass*.

On the last Friday of that month, a specific group, currently in their middle year, were free from this ordeal.

All you need to find are the candidates who:
* Would have been in the same group
* In the same year
* But didn't registered <br>

Can you name them all ?  <br>
	
NOTE: The names are in the increasing order of their roll no. <br>

## Flag Format
**`BBCTF{name1-rollno1_name2-rollno2_name3-rollno3_name4-rollno4}`**<br>
	Eg. If the names are Alice Matthew, Bob Marley,  Kate Emily Joseph, Charlie Jacob and roll no. are 1005,1025,1029, 1036 the flag would be **BBCTF{Alice-5_Bob-25_Kate-29_Charlie-36}**
