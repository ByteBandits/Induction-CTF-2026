# The Muggle’s Mistake

**Category** : OSINT
**Points** : 300

"Our surveillance team was tailing an eccentric suspect who claimed to be a 'pure-blood wizard' hiding in the human world. He was lost in a bustling Asian city, looking for a secret headquarters disguised as a muggle bakery.
He sent a photo to his accomplices with the message: 'The Portkey is hidden near the smell of fresh bread, right by the place that heals feet and serves sweet cookies. If you see the yellow chariots, you are close.'
We need to know exactly where this 'magical' bakery is. Find the coordinates of the bakery associated with the Boy Who Lived."
