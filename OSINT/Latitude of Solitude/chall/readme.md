## Description

This challenge is simpler than it first appears.

Everything you need is already in front of you.

You are given a single photograph.

Your task is straightforward:

**Find the exact location where this picture was taken.**  
Determine its **latitude and longitude**, then round both values to **two decimal places**.

Beyond the lands where trees refuse to grow,  
and daylight lingers in a silent glow,  
a still mirror rests beneath eternal frost —  
where maps end, and memories are lost.

Few have seen this place the world forgot,  
captured once, though no road leads there.  
The sun circles low — never quite gone —  
find where silence meets the northern dawn.
