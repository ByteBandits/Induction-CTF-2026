## Description

It was well past midnight when the last customer left.  
Chairs were flipped onto tables, lights dimmed, and the staff began closing the restaurant for the night.

That’s when someone noticed one corner booth hadn’t been touched.

A half-finished cup of coffee sat cold.  
A laptop charger still plugged into the wall.

Like whoever was sitting there had left in a hurry.

No laptop. No bag. No phone.

Just two things.

A small flash drive containing a single password-protected archive…  
…and a crumpled napkin.

Across it, written was a strange string:
fd1b05c1fcbe06caf1a2c133e3368236


At first it looked meaningless. Random.

But under the café’s blue neon lights, the ink seemed darker… almost layered.  
Like something had been written carefully, deliberately.

> “It’s all there… you just have to look at it bit by bit.”

Whatever they were hiding is still inside that archive.
