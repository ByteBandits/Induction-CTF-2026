## Description

Due to overwhelming user demand, the site recently added a **"Message the Admin"** feature so visitors can send suggestions and bug reports directly to the administrator.

Sounds helpful… but is it safe?

If user input reaches the admin without proper filtering, things might get interesting.

Try thinking like a browser.
