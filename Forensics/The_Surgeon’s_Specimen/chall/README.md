# The Surgeon’s Specimen

**Category** : Forensics
**Points** : 350

"We recovered a strange entity from the Surgeon’s lab labeled Subject-07. The Surgeon’s logbook was open to a page titled 'The Pentad Procedure'.
It reads: 'The specimen was too vocal, so I silenced it. I made exactly five incisions across the very top of its skull, removing its natural crown and stitching my own initials into the bone. Unless those five stitches are removed and the original crown is restored, the subject will remain a sightless ghost.
But be careful—the subject is a biological anomaly. It carries a parasite deep within its lower torso, a second life-form protected by a pressurized shell. You must look past the skin to find what lies beneath.'"
