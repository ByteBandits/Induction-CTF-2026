## Description

A while ago, I was wandering through the jungle when I heard a sudden, piercing shriek of pain.
I wanted to know what caused it, but fear held me back.
Instead, I recorded this video.

What I discovered was too dreadful to speak of openly, so I concealed it within the recording itself.
At first glance, the video may seem ordinary. Just noise. 
But in reality, silence is rarely empty, and containers often carry more than they reveal.
Some truths aren’t meant to be heard… they must be seen.

Somewhere inside this file lies the truth, carefully sealed away.
You might see where to look, but opening it will require more than just the right tool.
Listen closely. Inspect deeply.
And remember,some secrets refuse to speak unless you already know the words.
