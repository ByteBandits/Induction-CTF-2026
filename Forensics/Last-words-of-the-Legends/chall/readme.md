Once upon a time, there was a King of the Ocean named ______. He used to wear shoes while he lived in the ocean and this was a topic of debate for most of the people. Once a great warrior tried to confront the King about this topic but he was too scared that he might die doing this, but he had a lot of courage, so he went in the ocean not alone, but with a lots of *acid* thinking he might scare the king, but it was his bad luck that the king used to live in a *base*, so they got neutralized. He tried to say something before he died but no-one was able to hear it, there are some rumours that his voice got trapped in the neutralized result of the reaction-like War.  The way his voice got trapped was very unique, special of it's type. Can you tell me what we wanted to say ??<br>
