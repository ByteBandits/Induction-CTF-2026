## Description

The workstation was powered off in a hurry.

IT flagged the system after noticing unusual activity late at night —  
a large number of files were accessed, renamed, and then… gone.

By morning, the drive looked almost empty.  
Just a few harmless documents and leftover folders.  
Nothing suspicious at first glance.

But experience says otherwise.

People rarely delete things as cleanly as they think.

A raw disk image has been recovered from the machine.

Dig through what remains.

Somewhere in the remnants lies what they tried to hide.
